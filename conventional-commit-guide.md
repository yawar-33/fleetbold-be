# Conventional Commit Messages Guide

## Introduction

Conventional commit messages help maintain a consistent and informative commit history in your software projects. They follow a standardized format that includes a prefix and an optional emoji, followed by a short description. This guide outlines the conventions and provides examples.

## Commit Message Format

A conventional commit message consists of three parts:

1. **Prefix (Required):** Describes the purpose or category of the commit.

2. **Emoji (Optional):** Adds visual context to the commit.

3. **Short Description (Required):** Provides a concise summary of the commit.

## Prefixes

Choose a prefix that best represents the type of change made in the commit. Here are some commonly used prefixes:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for code style/formatting improvements
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` for general maintenance tasks

## Emojis (Optional)

Emojis can be added for additional visual context. They are not mandatory but can enhance readability. Here are some commonly used emojis:

- ✨ `:sparkles:` for new features
- 🐛 `:bug:` for bug fixes
- 📚 `:books:` for documentation changes
- 🎨 `:art:` for code style/formatting improvements
- 🔄 `:recycle:` for code refactoring
- ✔️ `:white_check_mark:` for tests
- 🚀 `:rocket:` for performance improvements
- 🔧 `:wrench:` for general maintenance tasks

## Short Description

Provide a short, meaningful description of the changes in the commit. Keep it concise but informative. Use imperative verbs (e.g., "Add feature," "Fix bug") and start with a capital letter.

## Examples

Here are some examples of conventional commit messages:

- `feat: ✨ Add user registration functionality`
- `fix: 🐛 Fix issue with login validation`
- `docs: 📚 Update API documentation`
- `style: 🎨 Format code with Prettier`
- `refactor: 🔄 Simplify error handling`
- `test: ✔️ Add unit tests for authentication`
- `chore: 🔧 Update dependencies`

## Conclusion

Using conventional commit messages with emojis and short descriptions can make your commit history more informative and consistent. It helps team members understand the purpose of each commit at a glance.

By following these conventions, you can maintain a clean and organized commit history that improves collaboration and project management.
